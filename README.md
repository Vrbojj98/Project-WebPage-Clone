# Project-WebPage-Clone

I am excited to share that I have created a Clone Static Page of a Digital Designer Bent Lindberg using HTML and CSS.

Following concepts I learned while creating this WebPage :-
1) A website for Icons ( Remix Icon ) and how to integrate those icons into our html code.
2) Best use of ID's and classes.
3) flex-direction: column .
4) nth child() of a class.
